<h1 style="color:white;"> Traditional Japanese car culture </h1>

<p style="color:white;"> The car culture in Japan started to gain momentum in the 1980's; Little did they know this small group would later change the world.<br>This then small group of people drove JDM (Japanese Domestic Market) cars, often modified with performance enhancing modifications such as intercoolers, fuel pumps, exhausts, spoilers and even NOS bottles, as well as some items just for looks like neon lighting, wraps, resprays and body kits.
As the culture started to rise, so did the presence of police, however due to the rules of street racing in Japan, the police very rarely engage in a pursuit. The reason for this is that there is a rule where if any pedestrian traffic is on the track, they stop the race at that moment, slow down and rejoin normal traffic. Some people do not obey this rule, but they are heavily frowned upon as they risk the freedom driving gives them
 </p>
<h2 style="color:white;"> Reasons To Race </h2>
<p style="color:white;"> The main Reason racing started was because people wanted to escape the seriousness of life. Driving was already a large part of life in japan due to the commutes often needed to get to jobs in the city, but these people wanted to show how serious they were, as well as have a rebellion against social normalities. It is because of this reason they drive at night, less people would see them, less people would be put at risk and it was their only free time.
There are many different "crews" of racers, they tend to be split into groups of friends, or by car type. For example the Kanjo Tribe use Honda Civics only, there are also less than 10 members of the club, most cars running their style of wrap tend to be impersonaters, they do not race, but they do show how big the community has reached, to the point where show cars are built in the style of the real machines in order to be popular. </p>

<h2 style="color:white;"> The Importance Of Stickers </h2>
<p style="color:white;"> Stickers in Japanese car culture have another meaning. Each sticker is from a garage, stickers are collected, traded and even raced for from garages. The more stickers your car has, the more experience you have as a racer. Many stickers are considered rare, as many of the garages have since closed due to one reason or another. A sticker shows one step in your path to racing, where you have been and maybe even where you will go in the future. </p>
